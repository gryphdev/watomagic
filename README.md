Example:
WhatsApp's recent privacy policy changes have triggered a huge migration to more privacy friendly apps like Signal and others. But most of us find it difficult to delete WhatsApp because everyone else uses it. Watomagic tries to make your migration easier by letting your friends automatically know that you are moved to another app. Just set an auto reply message something like "I am not using WhatsApp anymore. Please use Signal…" and let it do the work for you.

This app is not associated with any company including WhatsApp, Facebook or Signal.

### Troubleshooting

- Auto reply does not work even after Watomagic is enabled
  
  Watomagic relies on notifications for auto reply to work. Most users usually have notifications enabled so should work straight out of the box but otherwise please make sure notifications are enabled and app-specific fingerprint lock is disabled for Watomagic to work.

### FAQ

- Why not use WhatsApp business account for auto replies?
  
  You cannot use business account without accepting the new privacy policy that everyone is trying to avoid.

- Will this be available for iOS in the future
  
  This app relies on Android specific notification quick replies feature to function. This may not be possible on iOS.
